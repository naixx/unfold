# unfold

Just a basic idea of the implementation
It lacks:
* fullscreen since I don't quite understand how should it look like
* proper video preview
* video layout measurement
* state management
* video recycling while scrolling
* caching
* persisting data
* memory optimisations
* no research was done for a better video player and media chooser
